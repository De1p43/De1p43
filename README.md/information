#varible

# it is used for variable we cannot start variable with numbers there are types of variable like integer,float,string,boolean
a=1#a is variable 1 is integer
b=2.5#b is variable 2.5 is float number
c="python"#c is variable ("")we can define string
d=0#d is variable 0 or 1is boolean value
#swapping
a,b=b,a#, is used for swapping of two numbers
#operators
+#is used for adding two numbers
-#used for subtract two numbers
*#used for multiplied two number
%#use for divition of two numbers
/#use for module of two numbers
#assignment operator
+=#is used for adding two numbers
-=#used for subtract two numbers
*=#used for multiplied two number
%=#use for divition of two numbers
/=#use for module of two numbers
#if else
#it is used for give condition
h=10#h is variable 10 is integer 
c=65#c is variable 65 is integer
if h>c:#we wre give condition in if statement
    print("h")
else:#we are give else condition for if condition is wrong then else condition work
    print(c)
    
#if elif else
#it is used for give multipal condition
if:#first we give condition in if
    print()
elif:#elif is used for if condition is wrong then elif condition work
    print():
else:#else is use if and elif condition wrong then else condition work
#function
def function_name():#def is used for give function name
    print()
function_name()#for calling function we write function name in last
#while loop
while(i<+5):#while is loop where we give condition
    i+=1#(+=)operator is used for increse the number
#for loop
for i in range(1,10):#in for loop we directli define i as variable and give range of number
    print(i)#print(i) is used for dispay number
continue#is used for if condition is true then continue the output
break#is used for break the condition
